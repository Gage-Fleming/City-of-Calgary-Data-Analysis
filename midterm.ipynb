    "### 1.1 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The City of Calgary is consistently rated as one of the best places to live in the world according to the [EIU](https://moving2canada.com/news-and-features/features/planning/destination-guides/calgary/2022-eiu-liveability-index-three-canadian-cities-top-ten/). With its proximity to the Rocky Mountains and it's large business sector, Calgary provides to all demographics an excellent place to call home. With all the locations to visit within and around the city, Calgary has an avid commuter culture. I happen to be one such commuter.\n",
    "\n",
    "During my commuting time, I stick to roads in the southwest quadrant of the city and have never been in a traffic incident. However, many traffic incidents are reported via radio at high volume times. Combining this with my recent exploration of northwest and northeast quadrants of the city, I began to ask myself whether I am at a higher risk of being in an accident. Naively, I would assume that smaller roads and more cars would mean more incidents. In particular, downtown streets or busy highways with small merges seem like the most likely place to have an incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer the question of \"In what area's and at what time are commuters most likely to be involved in a traffic incident in Calgary.\" We can use data from the traffic incident dataset provided by the City of Calgary's [open data](https://data.calgary.ca/Transportation-Transit/Traffic-Incidents/35ra-9556) website. The data from this website can be used to get insight into the traffic incident patterns of the burgeoning metropolitan city by utilizing exploratory data analysis and further data exploration techniques such as predictive modeling and machine learning algorithms."

    "### 1.2 Literature Review and background\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic incidents are a heavily researched area. The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries) has an overview of traffic incidents within the global picture. Some key points are below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Approximately 1.3 million individuals die each year as a result of a traffic incident.\n",
    "- 93% of the world's fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries have approximately 60% of the world's vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upcoming analysis will use the global statistics as a soft guide. The data from Calgary is expected to show us a higher number of traffic incidents in lower-income areas, such as Forest Lawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research has also taken place on a more focused level within the City of Calgary. The dataset this project focuses on has been at the center of analysis before. Data analysis of the 2020 traffic incidents compared to 2019 was completed [here](https://pub-calgary.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=189649). It shows a sharp decline in overall incidents. Which is expected during the height of the lockdown in Alberta, Canada. While the linked paper focuses more on the stats from 2019 compared to 2020, this project is to paint a larger overall picture using the complete dataset. With the increase in population and return to regular road use, analyzing data from \"normal\" times is crucial to understanding incident-heavy areas today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another more informal analysis was conducted by Siavash Fard, M.Sc., P.Eng., PMP, which can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/prediction-traffic-incidents-calgary-siavash-fard-/). This analysis attempts to predict future incidents using the traffic incident dataset used in this study, in addition to data regarding traffic control devices. The report focuses on predicting traffic incidents, instead of visualizing and finding insights within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The former studies show a solid area for this project to focus on. We can use the former research projects to aid in defining the questions to answer throughout the analysis.\n"

    "### 1.3 Aims and Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exploratory data analysis is to get a high-level overview of traffic incidents in the City of Calgary. To pursue this goal, the following questions will be asked and answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which areas of the city have the most incidents?\n",
    "    - Hypothesis: Downtown roads and highways are the most dangerous roads.\n",
    "2. What time of day has the highest number of incidents?\n",
    "    - Hypothesis: Rush hours (8-9) and (5-6) are the most dangerous hours of weekdays.\n",
    "3. Does the day, week, month, or year cause variance in the frequency of incidents?\n",
    "    - Hypothesis: Winter months and weekdays are the most dangerous times to be on the road.\n",
    "4. What kind of incidents are happening?\n",
    "    - Does the type of incident affect the time between the start and end of said incident?\n",
    "    - Does the type of incident change based on location in the city?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering these questions will allow us to pinpoint unsafe areas during a commute within the city. The data source noted that the dataset is updated every 10 minutes with new traffic incidents. Therefore, as the dataset grows, more data will be brought in to more thoroughly examine the nature of traffic incidents in Calgary.\n"

    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, we will be focusing on traffic incident data provided by the City of Calgary. This data is an archive of reported traffic incidents within the city. These traffic incidents range from stalled vehicles to multi-vehicle collisions. The dataset is updated every ten minutes and has been updated since December 4th, 2017. Analyzing this dataset will answer the research questions, and it provides a large enough dataset to gain meaningful insights into the traffic incidents in Calgary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic incidents are collected via an advanced traveler information system, or ATIS, which collects information from a wide source of inputs. Inputs include commuter reported incidents via the WAZE application and traffic cameras. More information about Calgary's ATIS can be found [here](https://www.calgary.ca/roads/conditions/advanced-traveller-information-system.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides the most accurate picture of Calgary traffic incidents available for public use. It does however have its flaws. The website indicates, \"please note there may be gaps in the data due to system or script malfunction.\" This is a good indicator of problems areas to view during data cleansing. The data is also limited by the methods of reporting, for example instances where individuals may decide not to report. Instances of false positives, or errors in collection methodology. Ensuring effective data wrangling is employed will ensure the data is accurate and reasonably scrutinized."

    "The [Calgary Traffic Counts System](https://trafficcounts.calgary.ca/) is another open data source provided by the city of Calgary. It provides data related to traffic around major intersections. This data has been collected for over 40 years. Which would paint a much better historical picture of the traffic situation in Calgary. The data does not explicitly show incidents, rather the overall use of the roads within Calgary. It would be better suited towards understanding the growth and use of the roads in general as opposed to the roads and times which are the most dangerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the sources for accurate data are quite slim, we are limited to data provided by either the Alberta government or the City of Calgary. An example of data from the Alberta government can be found [here](https://open.alberta.ca/opendata/traffic-collision-casualties-alberta). This dataset is a high level overview of the number of incidents, deaths and injuries by year related to traffic incidents. Going from 2001-2014. This dataset paints an overall picture. However, each incident does not have associated information, there's no precise date and there is not any true analysis to follow because the dataset is so simple. It could be useful as supplementary data for this project. Comparing and contrasting Calgary's total incident rater to the provinces. Overall it is not ideal for our research area."

    "\n",
    "- Privacy\n",
    "    - The dataset does not have any identifying information within. It only contains information regarding the incident nature, location and time. Items like license plates, individuals involved or any other kind of identifying information is not contained within the data. Therefore, during analysis of this dataset, privacy concerns should be at a minimum. That being said, the individuals involved in the incidents reported in this dataset most likely do not know that their incident was recorded in this manner. While this is still a miniscule issue, it shows how much data is collected on an individuals actions throughout the day. Even down to their driving habits.\n",
    "- Misleading Insights\n",
    "    - This is a big area of concern with this dataset. To start, we know the data is formed from an RSS feed that originates from [this](https://www.calgary.ca/roads/conditions/traffic.html) website. This website reports, \"Details on road construction, road closures, detours, accidents and incidents that may affect your commute are shown on the map.\" All these details are collected using Calgary's ATIS system. Which is a network of traffic camera's and other data collection systems. A map of the traffic camera's in the City of Calgary can be found below. This information brings a couple of issues to light.\n",
    "        - The camera's only appear to be on heavily used roadways. An understandable decision in terms of efficiency, but an issue in terms of data collection. Area's of the city with lower traffic volumes can have traffic incidents which are not properly reported if the ATIS does not have sufficient monitoring abilities in that area.\n",
    "        - During poor visibility weather, the system may have issue's identifying incidents.\n",
    "        - The data has a large amount of missing data in the modified_dt column which is supposed to contain the date and time regarding when the incident was resolved. This is most likely due to system failure. However, it highlights a large issue with this dataset in the reliability of the modified_dt column. How accurate is the system in reporting when an incident is cleared? This question can't really be answered from our outside perspective. Therefore, any data regarding total incident time should be taken with a grain of salt.\n",
    "        - The data has a time period where a system malfunction occurred. From July 2019 - August 2019. This is to be kept in mind should analysis require pinpointing this time period.\n",
    "    - Overall the data should be used to gain a big picture understanding of the incident behaviour in Calgary. However, More meaningful insights should be cross-referenced with datasets from other city's and compared with former literature to ensure that the data presented and the current understanding of traffic incidents is comparable.\n",
    "- Biases\n",
    "    - The dataset's bias come more from ATIS limitations than potential socioeconomic bias points. The limitations of the ATIS system may lead to better reporting in higher observed roads and areas. Bias should be kept in mind when working with this data. However, it's not a forefront issue."

    "The new plot now shows that the formerly null/zeroed out data has valid entries. The new mean is thirty minutes. Upon looking for average traffic incident clean up times, there were no solid sources to pull from. Some articles such as [this](https://mynorthwest.com/1216262/washington-incident-response-2018/) one and [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2046043018300522) indicate traffic incidents can take anywhere from thirteen minutes to three hours to clear. For the purposes of this analysis the data seems to point toward 30 minutes average cleanup time in Calgary accidents. Of course this data is only as good as the reporting method, and as we originally saw a lot of the data was missing at the start. Any insights gained from this portion of the data should be taken with a grain of salt as we don't know the accuracy of the reporting timeline, we also don't know if the method of replacing a large portion of the data with the current average is necessarily accurate. However, it should be able to paint a blurry picture on the average clean-up time."

Overall this column confirms the hypothesis and highlights the fact that Calgary commuters should be more weary of incidents during high volume times."

    "\n",
    "Throughout this project. The data from Calgary's open data website about the traffic incidents in the City has been analysed. The data was taken from the website via SODA api and stored in a pandas dataframe. The dataframe allowed for simple manipulation and analysis using multiple different tools. The data has been visualized using simple bar plots, heatmaps and word clouds. These visualisations have been combined with simple statistics to paint a very broad picture of the traffic incidents in Calgary. Through these approaches simple insights have been gained that have confirmed a lot of preconceived assumptions about traffic incidents in Calgary. ALl of this analysis was in the vein of answers simple research questions. The data successfully answered most of our research questions, but fell short in some areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which areas of the city have the most incidents?\n",
    "    - Hypothesis: Downtown roads and highways are to be the most dangerous roads.\n",
    "        -  This hypothesis was confirmed by the dataset. We saw that high speed roadways with multiple merge and off ramps pose a significantly higher risk to commuter in the city of Calgary. Streets and avenues that are mostly downtown also made up a significant portion of the reported incidents in the dataset. Thereby, confirming that commuters using these roads are at a higher risk of being affected by a traffic incident in some manner.\n",
    "2. What time of day has the highest number of incidents?\n",
    "    - Hypothesis: Rush hours (8-9) and (5-6) are the most dangerous hours of a day.\n",
    "        -  This hypothesis was also confirmed by the analysis. Plotting the hours the traffic incidents took place highlighted how rush hours were their highest local maximum in terms of incident counts. With the rush hour between 6-8 being the most dangerous time of the day. While this point may seem obvious when confirmed, the data helps reinforce this idea and gives commuters if anything more reason to be just a little safer during rush hour. Especially on high speed roads.\n",
    "3. Does the day, week, month, or year cause variance in the frequency of incidents?\n",
    "    - Hypothesis: Winter months and weekdays are the most dangerous times to be on the road.\n",
    "        - This hypothesis was also confirmed by our analysis. We saw that winter months had a higher number of incidents than the mean and that weekdays had almost double the amount of incidents compared too weekends. While a driver should always be fully aware during a commute. This data highlights that vehicles should have winter tires on and competent defensive driver on the roads especially when the conditions are not ideal. A surprising insight that was gained from this part of the anlays was the fact that Friday is the most dangerous day to commute in the City. My assumption would be Monday. HHowever, Monday was the third-lowest day for total incidents. Visualising how traffic behaviour changes on a time basis deserves more attention in future analysis projects.\n",
    "4. What kind of incidents are happening?\n",
    "    - Does the type of incident affect the time between the start and end of accident?\n",
    "        - Unfortunately, our dataset lacked sufficient information to properly distinguish the type of incidents. The description for almost all incidents was a very simple sentence, which contained information that would be helpful to drivers planning their daily commute, but not information that actually describes the severity of the crash, type of incident etc. This is a point I believe the ATIS could be upgraded to include. Having this type of information would allow for easy analysis of roads in the city that are more dangerous than other in a higher degree of understanding.\n",
    "    - Does the type of incident change based on location in the city?\n",
    "        -  Our dataset also failed to answer this question as before the incident info did not contain sufficient information to answer this question. As very few incidents had quality information past Traffic Incident, left lane blocked etc. Hopefully in the future the incident info can be more flushed out to maybe highlight things such as pedestrians involved, bikers involved, motorcycle incident etc. TO again gain a deeper understanding of exaclty what dangers each road can potentialy pose to not only commuters, but also do non-commuters."

    "### 6.2 Critical Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful data analysis is based on two things. The quality of the data and the individual analysing the data. Throughout this project, I have come to realize that the chosen dataset is great for it's intended task, but not more. It's meant to provide commuters reasonably accurate information on the current road conditions in Calgary. Upon reflection, it's clear this limited the avenues I could proceed with in this analysis. As discussed above, gaining a deeper understanding into what incidents are happening when and where is difficult when we only know that an incident occurred at x coordinate. For city's to accurately understand their driving patterns and areas to focus on, I believe more complex ATIS tracking systems need to be implemented to help traffic analysts point city planners in the right direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was not the only area that let to limitations and challenges. My skills as a data analyst also provided a challenge. Python and it's many data oriented libraries serves as a phenomenal tool to help understand any given dataset. However, it's clear after many hours of research and documentation review you can't become proficient at data analysis after one dataset or even 20. It's an ever-growing field and the knowledge base is massive. It's difficult to know which path you should take to ensure you get accurate results from the data. I am proud of this project. However, there are clear area's for improvement, those of which are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating an interactive map with the data is something I originally planned to do. After researching the implementation, it was clear it was not feasible with the current timeline I have. The map was intended to show the incidents by year and have markers that were interactive. I also wanted to implement a choropleth map to help get an idea of the incidents by city districts. That too proved beyond my current skill-set. This data is meant to be displayed on a map of some kind, and I believe that further exploration with mapping this data can lead to valuable insights that I fell short of.\n",
    "- Replacing NA values is another area I feel deserves to be reviewed. It's hard to verify that you made the correct decision in either replacing NA values or removing them from the dataset entirely. Given more time, it would be worthwhile to see if removing all invalid values instead of replacing them with the median is a better idea.\n",
    "- Pandas is an extremely powerful tool and properly using it as a beginner is a big undertaking. As an individual who has mostly used applications like excel it's hard to adjust to a programming workflow and manipulate data without a visual aid. Through many attempts, the pandas dataframe turned into fairly wrangled data, but I believe that a deeper understanding of pandas would lead ot better insights and a more polished research project.\n"

    "## 7. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the course of this EDA, common beliefs around the City of Calgary's traffic incident behaviors have been more or less confirmed through data analysis. The reader now has a general understanding of what roads and during what times traffic incidents are most likely to occur in the City.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has also been refined to allow for further analysis such as predictive modelling. Should this topic be further pursued I believe this dataset combined with other data from open Calgary and open Alberta/Canada can provide gainful insight that will allow city planners to evaluate the success of the road system in Calgary. For example, combining traffic counts with incident counts, the city could confirm if new intersections types such as the newly implemented [diamond](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/diverging-diamond-interchange-opens-calgary-1.4245773) in the south of the city actually reduced total incidents while maintaining the same amount of traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data can also be used to start a predictive modeling analysis to start aiding in the City's incident response procedures. Using inputs such as this refined dataset alongside weather and traffic count data an AI model could aid in alerting the City to potential high congestion days. Which would allow them to prepare ahead of time and thereby reduce potential fatalities and clean up times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall traffic data of all kind should be further explored and refined to ensure that governments and commuters reap the benefits from safe roads, properly planned intersections and proper civil engineering through data analysis."
