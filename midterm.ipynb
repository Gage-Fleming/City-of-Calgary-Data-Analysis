    "### 1.1 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The City of Calgary is consistently rated as one of the best places to live in the world according to the [EIU](https://moving2canada.com/news-and-features/features/planning/destination-guides/calgary/2022-eiu-liveability-index-three-canadian-cities-top-ten/). With its proximity to the Rocky Mountains and it's large business sector, Calgary provides to all demographics an excellent place to call home. With all the locations to visit within and around the city, Calgary has an avid commuter culture. I happen to be one such commuter.\n",
    "\n",
    "During my commuting time, I stick to roads in the southwest quadrant of the city and have never been in a traffic incident. However, many traffic incidents are reported via radio at high volume times. Combining this with my recent exploration of northwest and northeast quadrants of the city, I began to ask myself whether I am at a higher risk of being in an accident. Naively, I would assume that smaller roads and more cars would mean more incidents. In particular, downtown streets or busy highways with small merges seem like the most likely place to have an incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer the question of \"In what area's and at what time are commuters most likely to be involved in a traffic incident in Calgary.\" We can use data from the traffic incident dataset provided by the City of Calgary's [open data](https://data.calgary.ca/Transportation-Transit/Traffic-Incidents/35ra-9556) website. The data from this website can be used to get insight into the traffic incident patterns of the burgeoning metropolitan city by utilizing exploratory data analysis and further data exploration techniques such as predictive modeling and machine learning algorithms."

    "### 1.2 Literature Review and background\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic incidents are a heavily researched area. The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries) has an overview of traffic incidents within the global picture. Some key points are below:\n",
    "- Approximately 1.3 million individuals die each year as a result of a traffic incident.\n",
    "- 93% of the world's fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries have approximately 60% of the world's vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global stats aid in guiding the data analysis. The data from Calgary will be expected to show us a higher number of traffic incidents in lower income areas, such as Forest Lawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research has also been done on a more focused level within the City of Calgary. The dataset this project focuses on has been at the center of analysis before. Data analysis of the 2020 traffic incidents compared to 2019 was completed [here](https://pub-calgary.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=189649). It shows a sharp decline in overall incidents. Which is to be expected during the height of the lockdown in Alberta, Canada. While the linked paper focuses more on the stats from 2019 compared to 2020, this project is meant to paint a larger overall picture using the complete dataset. With the increase in population and return to regular road use, analysing data from \"normal\" times is crucial to understanding incident heavy areas today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another more informal analysis was conducted by Siavash Fard, M.Sc., P.Eng., PMP, which is posted on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/prediction-traffic-incidents-calgary-siavash-fard-/). This analysis attempts to predict future incidents using the traffic incident dataset used in this study, in addition to data regarding traffic control devices. The analysis focuses on prediction techniques, as opposed to visualizing and finding insights within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The former studies show a solid area for this project to focus on. We can use the former research projects and define teh areas where we need to focus on below."

    "### 1.3 Aims and Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine the nature of the traffic incidents in Calgary, the following questions will need to be answered:\n",
    "1. Which areas of the city have the most incidents?\n",
    "    - Hypothesis: Downtown roads and highways are to be the most dangerous roads.\n",
    "2. What time of day has the highest number of incidents?\n",
    "    - Hypothesis: Rush hours (8-9) and (5-6) are the most dangerous hours of a day.\n",
    "3. Does the day, week, month, or year cause variance in the frequency of incidents?\n",
    "    - Hypothesis: Winter months and weekdays are the most dangerous times to be on the road.\n",
    "4. What kind of incidents are happening?\n",
    "    - Does the type of incident affect the time between the start and end of accident?\n",
    "    - Does the type of incident change based on location in the city?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Answering these questions will allow us to pinpoint unsafe areas during a commute within the city. The data source noted that the dataset is updated every 10 minutes with new traffic incidents. Therefore, as the dataset grows, we will be able to bring in more data to more thoroughly examine the nature of traffic incidents in Calgary."

    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, we will be focusing on traffic incident data provided by the City of Calgary. This data is an archive of reported traffic incidents within the city. These traffic incidents range from stalled vehicles to multi-vehicle collisions. The dataset is updated every ten minutes and has been updated since December 4th, 2017. Analyzing this dataset will answer the research questions, and it provides a large enough dataset to gain meaningful insights into the traffic incidents in Calgary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic incidents are collected via an advanced traveler information system, or ATIS, which collects information from a wide source of inputs. Inputs include commuter reported incidents via the WAZE application and traffic cameras. More information about Calgary's ATIS can be found [here](https://www.calgary.ca/roads/conditions/advanced-traveller-information-system.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides the most accurate picture of Calgary traffic incidents available for public use. It does however have its flaws. The website indicates, \"please note there may be gaps in the data due to system or script malfunction.\" This is a good indicator of problems areas to view during data cleansing. The data is also limited by the methods of reporting, for example instances where individuals may decide not to report. Instances of false positives, or errors in collection methodology. Ensuring effective data wrangling is employed will ensure the data is accurate and reasonably scrutinized."

    "This data set is well suited to answer our research questions. This can be confirmed by comparing it to other sources of data within the traffic of Calgary sphere of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Calgary Traffic Counts System](https://trafficcounts.calgary.ca/) is another open data source provided by the city of Calgary. It provides data related to traffic around major intersections. This data has been collected for over 40 years. Which would paint a much better historical picture of the traffic situation in Calgary. The data does not explicitly show incidents, rather the overall use of the roads within Calgary. It would be better suited towards understanding the growth and use of the roads in general as opposed to the roads and times which are the most dangerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the sources for accurate data are quite slim, we are limited to data provided by either the Alberta government or the City of Calgary. An example of data from the Alberta government can be found [here](https://open.alberta.ca/opendata/traffic-collision-casualties-alberta). This dataset is a high level overview of the number of incidents, deaths and injuries by year related to traffic incidents. Going from 2001-2014. This dataset paints an overall picture. However, each incident does not have associated information, there's no precise date and there is not any true analysis to follow because the dataset is so simple. It could be useful as supplementary data for this project. Comparing and contrasting Calgary's total incident rater to the provinces. Overall it is not ideal for our research area."

    "\n",
    "- Privacy\n",
    "    - The dataset does not have any identifying information within. It only contains information regarding the incident nature, location and time. Items like license plates, individuals involved or any other kind of identifying information is not contained within the data. Therefore, during analysis of this dataset, privacy concerns should be at a minimum. That being said, the individuals involved in the incidents reported in this dataset most likely do not know that their incident was recorded in this manner. While this is still a miniscule issue, it shows how much data is collected on an individuals actions throughout the day. Even down to their driving habits.\n",
    "- Misleading Insights\n",
    "    - This is a big area of concern with this dataset. To start, we know the data is formed from an RSS feed that originates from [this](https://www.calgary.ca/roads/conditions/traffic.html) website. This website reports, \"Details on road construction, road closures, detours, accidents and incidents that may affect your commute are shown on the map.\" All these details are collected using Calgary's ATIS system. Which is a network of traffic camera's and other data collection systems. A map of the traffic camera's in the City of Calgary can be found below. This information brings a couple of issues to light.\n",
    "        - The camera's only appear to be on heavily used roadways. An understandable decision in terms of efficiency, but an issue in terms of data collection. Area's of the city with lower traffic volumes can have traffic incidents which are not properly reported if the ATIS does not have sufficient monitoring abilities in that area.\n",
    "        - During poor visibility weather, the system may have issue's identifying incidents.\n",
    "        - The data has a large amount of missing data in the modified_dt column which is supposed to contain the date and time regarding when the incident was resolved. This is most likely due to system failure. However, it highlights a large issue with this dataset in the reliability of the modified_dt column. How accurate is the system in reporting when an incident is cleared? This question can't really be answered from our outside perspective. Therefore, any data regarding total incident time should be taken with a grain of salt.\n",
    "        - The data has a time period where a system malfunction occurred. From July 2019 - August 2019. This is to be kept in mind should analysis require pinpointing this time period.\n",
    "    - Overall the data should be used to gain a big picture understanding of the incident behaviour in Calgary. However, More meaningful insights should be cross-referenced with datasets from other city's and compared with former literature to ensure that the data presented and the current understanding of traffic incidents is comparable.\n",
    "- Biases\n",
    "    - The dataset's bias come more from ATIS limitations than potential socioeconomic bias points. The limitations of the ATIS system may lead to better reporting in higher observed roads and areas. Bias should be kept in mind when working with this data. However, it's not a forefront issue."

    "The new plot now shows that the formerly null/zeroed out data has valid entries. The new mean is thirty minutes. Upon looking for average traffic incident clean up times, there were no solid sources to pull from. Some articles such as [this](https://mynorthwest.com/1216262/washington-incident-response-2018/) one and [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2046043018300522) indicate traffic incidents can take anywhere from thirteen minutes to three hours to clear. For the purposes of this analysis the data seems to point toward 30 minutes average cleanup time in Calgary accidents. Of course this data is only as good as the reporting method, and as we originally saw a lot of the data was missing at the start. Any insights gained from this portion of the data should be taken with a grain of salt as we don't know the accuracy of the reporting timeline, we also don't know if the method of replacing a large portion of the data with the current average is necessarily accurate. However, it should be able to paint a blurry picture on the average clean-up time."
